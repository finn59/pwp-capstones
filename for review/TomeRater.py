#   description  :  class TomeRater manages the many methods of class User and class Book,
#                   keeps records of users and books, and has methods to analyze object data
#
#                   class User handles attributes associated with users
#
#                   class Book handles attributes associated with books
#
#                   class Fiction is a subclass of book, and inherits title and author attributes,
#                   defines a class Fiction specific attribute: author
#
#                   class Non_Fiction is a subclass of book, and inherits title and author attributes,
#                   defines a class Non_Fiction specific attributes: subject, and level
#
#   known issues :  method highest_rated_book in class TomeRater fails when calling
#                   method get_average_rating in class Books
#                   haven't been able to solve this problem so far.
